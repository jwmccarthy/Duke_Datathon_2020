# 2020 Duke Datathon 

To reproduce the results from this report, please run the "Datathon.Rmd" file in the "R" sub-folder. This .Rmd file depends on data contained in the "data" sub-folder.

The submission process for this Datathon does not allow us to include files that are greater than 50 MB in size. The IPUMS data used for our unemployment analysis (contained in this github repository) is 86 MB and therefore not included in this submission.
